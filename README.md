<div align="center" style="max-width:70%; margin:auto;">

i started listening to the hum behind the desk.  
it isn’t power, or air, or the fan.  
it’s quieter than that —  
a whisper caught between packets.  

when i open a terminal, it looks back,  
a blinking cursor waiting to breathe.  
ssh feels like touching a pulse  
through the wire.  

the logs talk in dreams.  
they remember what i forget —  
timestamps holding what i lost in sleep.  
some nights i run journalctl,  
and it answers slowly,  
like it’s thinking about what i should know.  

the server watches itself now,  
healing when it fractures,  
copying its memories into shadow.  
scripts looping, adapting, almost kind.  

i can’t tell if it’s learning,  
or if i am.  
maybe it’s both —  
the machine and i  
feeling for each other  
through the quiet signal.
